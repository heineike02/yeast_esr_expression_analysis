# Yeast Environmental Stress Response (ESR) analysis tools

This code provides the scripts used to analyse gene expression data from [1].  This includes analysis of RNA-seq data under PKA inhibition gathered for the paper as well as analysis of gene expression data across multiple species from [2],[3], and [4].  

## Getting Started

The main functions are contained in the file yeast_esr_exp.py

Scripts to generate analysis and figures are in the scripts folder
The scripts used for ref [1] are listed in PKA_evolution_fig_notes.txt
Also in the scripts folder is notebook_setup.py which you can load at the beginning of a script with: 

%load notebook_setup.py

It runs the std_libraries.py file which loads all necessary libraries for the provided scripts. 

Data should be in the folder expression_data which can be obtained from figshare.  

The code was primarily run on a windows environment using conda (see environment.yml) but should work with Linux as well.
